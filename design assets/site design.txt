What is my site supposed to actually do?

	The site is there to give my information to any visitors, both my professional portfolio
	and contact information, as well as my social network contact information and how anyone 
	can get in touch with me, professionally and socially.

Who is this site for?

	This site is for anyone that wants to know more about me and wants to see my
	my portfolio for web design. This will be people and businesses that are looking to hire
	me in the future.
	
Who is my target audience?

	My target audience is my professor, of course, as well as people that may want to contact
	me for future employment and opportunities. 
	
How will I achieve the target goal of my site?

	I'll use a clean, simple design to quickly get my message across, and to give people
	my professional information. 
	
Other stuff

	I'll stick to a simple color scheme, no more than 3 colors. Mainly black and white with 
	a small dash of other colors to highlight things and contrast visually. I'll use simple 
	fonts with nothing crazy, I'm thinking Helvetica or Calibri, but definitely a sans-serif
	font. I'll use a menu bar, probably at the top of the page, to handle navigation and to
	let the reader move between sections of my site.
