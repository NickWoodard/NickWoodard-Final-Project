# NickWoodard-Final-Project
Final Project for CSET 3100

For my first website, and my final project for this class, I created a website that uses the basics that we learned over the semester.
My goal was to create a website that would serve as a means for me to introduce myself, tell people who I am, what I do, and what I like.

For the most part, I just wanted a very simple website. I didn't go with background images or any fancy effects, and I stuck
with a static blue background and white text. I have everything separated by horizontal rules, and I really like how they
create clear areas of the site. 

A lot of the site borrows code that it's already used. For instance, a lot of my paragraphs share the "hobbies" class, because
that class is already formatted with how I want all my paragraphs to look. It's already there from my old site for the class,
so I think I'll keep it around for right now. 

Something that helped me a ton when reusing code was the ul code. I was really stuck on getting my images to align how I wanted 
them, I think I spent a good hour using floats, aligns, a whole bunch of silly things that didn't work well at all. Then it
struck me that my list for my skills, that I've been using since one of the first weeks of the semester, has been doing that
for weeks and working how I wanted my images to work. So I just copied that code for the ul and put a new name on it for the CSS.

I'm honestly not that great at Javascript, and it's still pretty tough for me, so for my site I just opted for a simple,
randomized "goodbye!" message. I think I could get the hang of it in the future, if I keep practising. Programming is
usually something I can pick up pretty well, but Javascript is taking some extra time to sink in.
